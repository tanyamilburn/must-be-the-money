  ## Description
 This challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site.  It uses the Express.js API and configures it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Usage
  This is only a back end application. User will need to use Insomnia to test get, post, and delete routes. 
 
  ## Installation
  * Clone the repository.
  * Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your own credientals to the file.
  * open the db file in the terminal and login in to mysql with the `mysql -u root -p`
  * run `source db/schema.sql`
  * open the integrated terminal and run `npm install`
  * In the same terminal, run `npm run seed` to seed the database
  * open the  'server.js' file and run `npm start` to use the models.
  * open Insomnia to run various get, post, and put commands
